## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Sales, Profit, and Budget** data using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to build interactive dashboards that help track performance across **categories, time, and geography**, while also comparing actual results to budgets and prior years.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources  
- **Sales dataset**: Transactions including sales, profit, quantity, customer, region, and category.  
- **Budget dataset**: Yearly and monthly budget allocations by category.  
- **Calendar table**: Date dimension created in Power Query for time intelligence.

## ðŸ”„ Data Transformation and ETL  

### ðŸ”¹ Power Query  
I performed several transformation steps to prepare the data for analysis:  
- Cleaned and standardized sales data (removed nulls, renamed columns).  
- Created a **Date Table** for time-based analysis.  
- Merged sales and budget datasets.  
- Changed data types and applied filters for valid transactions.  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling  
The project follows a **Star Schema** approach:  
- **Fact Table**: Sales  
- **Dimension Tables**: Date, Product, Customer, Region, Category  
- Relationships were created to ensure accurate aggregations and filtering.  
- Added hierarchies (Year â†’ Quarter â†’ Month).

### ðŸ”¹ DAX Calculations  
I created multiple measures in DAX for KPIs and analysis. Some examples:  

```DAX
-- Total Sales
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales])

-- Total Profit
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

-- Sales vs Prior Year
Sales Prior Year = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR))

-- Sales Variance %
Sales % Variance = 
DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales Prior Year], [Sales Prior Year], 0)

-- Budget Achievement %
Budget Achievement = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Budget], 0)
